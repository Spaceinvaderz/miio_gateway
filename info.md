# Miio Gateway

## What for?

In general, it allows (modified) devices like `lumi.gateway.mieu01` to be controlled via LAN **instead of Xiaomi Cloud**.

Once you replace original `miio_client` with modified one â€“ you won't be able to control gateway via Mi Home app.
But... why you would? ;)

Please check the repository for [the repository](https://github.com/Spaceinvaderz/miio_gateway/blob/master/README.md) and usage instructions.
